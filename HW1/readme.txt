HW_1 is a program using two ways to do the same thing:compute n!.
	
User can try different numbers they want until enter -1.




HW_2 is a program listing all combination of elements.User can enter the characters 

in any order and any amount of it. Like abc¡Babfg and hjklm...... .It will list all combination of characters.

But DO NOT using the space,like a b c,or the answer will be wrong.
